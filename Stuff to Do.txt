~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yesterday
Simone and Jared




Plan of Attack

4 PM:
-Print out working code.
PRint resume.
Clean up Github.
Write Personal statement for LinekdIn and STackOverflow and resume.
-Ask Jonathan for advice later on job fair.

Today
Do CSS stylings.
clean up github

-Finish preliminary CSS.
  -style forms.
  -views for all.
-Search criteria.
-install on Homebrew.
-Status messages /  news feed
pg-search

TO DO
-Store multiple photos (with flag on main one)

Zip Code -- leading zeroes problem/

-Go through CSS guide and then use that to help with form.
-Have bar at the bottom

When tired  - add more CSS.
  -Have main bar at top of page, but smaller one after its there.
-start incorporating about.me

Make logo clickable.



BY MID DAY: START CSS
-Layout and positioning
http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html
The rails guide on layouts is a good place to start. Look at Section 3 - Structuring Layouts

There are several ways to use a different layout but one of the easiest is to simply add a file with the same name as your controller in the layouts/ folder. So if your controller is PostsController then adding a layouts/post.html.haml would cause rails to use that layout. If no such layout is found, and no other layouts are specified, rails will use the default of layouts/application.html.haml



-multiple CSS files. rough or no?

-how to make things like italiczed and red? would i just have to wrap it in a DIV tag with a class name and then addclass?


NOT IMPORTANT SHIT TO DO:
-give only half.
-Do "CSs measurements.txt" whenever bored
-put mixes on computer
-wheres my amazon?




Thursday
-Refactor some shit.
-Add Picture uplaoding after they teach how to.
-Pagify
-PLAN WYSWIG EDITOR

-Check the old JS/Rails stuff in order to see if there's anything more to be done.
-Make some seed data that'll just get created period.
omniauth

WEEKEND

Important: Each time you migrate your database or change it, you must also update the test database by calling rake db:test:prepare.

Write RSpec tests for every model as you go. This is an easy win, and a huge boon for employment.

Do I have test coverage for my models?

QUESTION

self.get_acceptable_responses
